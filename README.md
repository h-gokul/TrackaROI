# TrackaROI
This repository is a study of various tracking algorithms as a part of my Computer Vision self-study. 
For a given video file, one can select a number of objects to track by selecting a Region of Interest(ROI) by drawing a bounding box. A tracking algorithm is chosen by the user to track these objects. 

##### Tracking algorithms:
 - Kanade-Lucas-Tomas (KLT) tracker
 - Meanshift Tracker
 - Boosting Tracker
 - MIL Tracker
 - KCF Tracker
 - TLD Tracker
 - MedianFlow Tracker
 - GoTurn Tracker
 - Mosse Tracker
 - CSRT Tracker
